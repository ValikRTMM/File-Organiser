Hello everyone, and welcome to File Organiser!

File Organizer made to organise your desktop or any other directories. There are ton of the same projects on GitHub, but there is only my vision to this program and expirience in the programming.
✔️ Works seamlessly on macOS.

[!] This is only my second attempt at creating a project, and I must confess, I was also afraid because of my 
"shit code". I really don't want to waste your time, but if you have any tips or suggestions for a beginner, I would be very grateful :)

# How to Use
-> Run the executable: file_organizer.exe

-> Alternatively, execute the following command in your terminal: python3 or python file_organizer.py


Thank you for checking out File Organizer! Feel free to explore the project on GitHub for additional details and updates.
